      "Summary: International businessman Elon Musk has been actively involved in politics, particularly in the United States and Europe, throughout the majority of his career. Despite historically donating to and voting for both Democrats and Republicans, his political contributions have since shifted almost entirely to right-wing candidates and politicians (both centre-right and far-right), outright stating in 2022 that he would no longer support Democrats. In the time since, Musk has become more vocal about his views, frequently promoting conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats, election fraud and immigration. As a result, he has been described as right-wing and conservative, though he rejects the conservative label.\n",
